Prompt2Act: Transforming Prompts into Sequence of Actions with Large Foundation Model
① 传统的反省自己做不了，基于llm的方案xxx，很多动作不能完成的时候需要代码生成。To deal with this, we introduce 
② It supports versatile multimodal prompts for purpose specification. It can effectively utilize not only text instructions but also a diverse of goal images, and various combination of both text and visual information, to define purpose precisely. 
③ Through comprehensive evaluations in both real-world and simulated settings, Prompt2Act consistently surpasses existing LLM-based planners, showcasing its efficiency across various of open-world manipulation tasks. Moreover, our zero-shot approach outperforming several state-of-the-art learning-based strategies in various challenging scenarios.Our framework can be applied to real-world scenarios in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner, with the extensibility of the Prompt2Act framework allowing users to integrate additional foundation models for broader applications.
